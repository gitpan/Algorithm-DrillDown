You! Yes, you doing CPAN testing on amd64-freebsd 6.2-release with
perl-5.00505, what are you smoking using such a modern platform with such an
antique Perl? Honestly...

Anyway, the *other* "our" that I'd missed in 1.002 has been taken out and

One of the tests used "our" and broke on Perls <= 5.6, so it now does "use
vars".

Initial release.
